## **Colpitts Oscillator Circuit**

### **Project Overview**
This project involves the design and implementation of a Colpitts oscillator circuit that generates a stable sinusoidal waveform. The circuit is built using an LC tank circuit with capacitive feedback, ensuring a reliable oscillation frequency. A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout has been designed to improve signal integrity and minimize noise.

### **Objectives**
- Design and simulate a Colpitts oscillator to generate stable oscillations.
- Achieve a precise oscillation frequency using an LC tank circuit.
- Implement a PCB layout to enhance circuit performance and reduce interference.

### **Circuit Design**
The circuit consists of the following main components:
- **LC Tank Circuit**: A combination of inductors and capacitors that determines the oscillation frequency.
- **Active Device**: A transistor (2N2222) provides the necessary gain.
- **Biasing Network**: Resistors to set the operating point and stabilize the circuit.

### **Simulation & Results**
- **Simulation Tool Used**: LTSpice
- **FFT Analysis** confirms waveform purity and expected frequency response.
- **Observed Frequency Range**: ~5.03 MHz.

### **Theoretical vs. Simulated Results**
| Method         | Frequency (MHz) |
|---------------|---------------|
| Theoretical   | 5.03 MHz      |
| Simulated (FFT) | 4.998 MHz     |

### **PCB Design**
